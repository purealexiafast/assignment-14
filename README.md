# assignment-14 = Tech Blog

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

The goal of this Model-View-Controller Tech Blog was to create a website that developers can post to and also comment on other developers posts. Building this website from scratch was extensive to say the least. I utilized Handlebars, Sequalize and Express. The file structure was also quite extensive. Many routes had to be created. Overall I found this assignment to be challenging.
